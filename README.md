# ML_Intro
My formal introduction to Machine Learning via project example.

The following machine learning exercise covers the 
following subjects:

	- Installing the Python and SciPy platform.
	- Loading a dataset.
	- Summarizing a dataset.
	- Visualizing a dataset.
	- Evaluating machine learning algorithms.
	- Making predictions using machine learning algorithms.

Files:

	- ML_HotScript_01.py
	- iris.data (keep this in the same directory as the main file)
	
Python version:

	- Python 3.7.2
	
Packages used:

	- SciPy is a collection of numerical algorithms and 
	  domain-specific toolboxes.
	- Numpy is the fundamental package for numerical
	  computation.
	- Matplotlib for data visualization.
	- Pandas for data extraction and preparation.
	- Sklearn for working with classical ML algorithms.

Packages kept in mind for future consideration:

	- Tensorflow for Deep Learning.
	- Theano is also for Deep Learning.
	- Seaborn is another data visualization library.
